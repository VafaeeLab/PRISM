# Multi-Omics Prognostic Marker Discovery and Survival Modeling: A Case Study on Pan-Cancer Survival Analyses in Women's Cancers

Survival analysis is essential for predicting patient outcomes and guiding personalized cancer treatments. While multi-omics data offers valuable insights, its high dimensionality complicates analysis and clinical application. Many studies still rely on the traditional Cox proportional hazards model, with limited exploration of alternative survival algorithms or robust feature selection methods. Few frameworks effectively integrate features across multiple omics modalities. To address these issues, we developed PRISM (PRognostic marker Identification and Survival Modelling through Multi-omics Integration), a comprehensive framework designed to improve survival predictions and identify key prognostic markers. PRISM systematically compares various feature selection methods and survival models, and employs a robust pipeline that selects features from single-omics data, integrating them through feature-level fusion and multi-stage refinement. Applied to TCGA data for Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (CESC), Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (OV) and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), PRISM demonstrated that integrating DNA methylation, miRNA, and copy number variation data provided complementary information, significantly outperforming other modality combinations in three cancers (BRCA: C-index 0.77; CESC: 0.80; UCEC: 0.76). Pan-cancer analysis further revealed shared oncogenic pathways and therapeutic targets. PRISM provides a scalable, generalizable solution for multi-omics integration, advancing cancer research and precision medicine.

Computational Environment
All analyses were conducted on the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Katana HPC and Gadi (NCI), utilizing 16 CPUs and 124 GB of memory per job to process large-scale omics data efficiently.

While optimized for HPC, the pipeline can also run on local machines by reducing data size or enabling parallelization.
The current parallelization code assumes 16 cores.
Pipeline Overview
To ensure reproducibility, we recommend running the scripts in the following order:

1. TCGA Data Extraction & Preprocessing
ðŸ“Œ Extract and preprocess omics data (GE, ME, CNV, DM) for each cancer type.

Scripts: TCGA_BRCA.R, TCGA_CESC.R, TCGA_OV.R, TCGA_UCEC.R
Note: Due to API changes from the GDC Portal (as of March 17, 2025), the GDCquery_clinic function in TCGAbiolinks may not work. You may need to manually download clinical data from the GDC Portal. For convenience, we have also provided preprocessed data.
2. Evaluation of Individual Filter Methods
ðŸ“Œ Evaluate individual feature selection methods.

Script: individual_selection.R
3. Cross-Validation Feature Selection
ðŸ“Œ Run cross-validation-based feature selection to identify key prognostic features.

Script: CV_method.R
4. Multi-Omics Integration - One-Stage vs. Two-Stage Refinement
ðŸ“Œ Compare one-stage and two-stage refinement for multi-omics feature selection.

Scripts: first_stage_refinement.R, second_stage_refinement.R
5. Pan-Cancer Downstream Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Perform pan-cancer analyses to identify shared pathways and therapeutic targets.

Script: pan-cancer.R
