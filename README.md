# Enhancing Cancer Survival Predictions Through Multi-Omics Integration and Machine Learning: A Pan-Cancer Study Using TCGA Data

Survival analysis plays a pivotal role in cancer research, offering critical insights into patient prognosis and potential outcomes. With advancements in imaging, sequencing, and profiling technologies, multi-omics data has become increasingly accessible, enhancing the precision of cancer diagnosis and treatment. This thesis seeks to improve cancer survival predictions by applying feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms to single modalities from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We further enhance these predictions by integrating selected features using early and late fusion approaches, evaluating their impact on survival outcomes.

The study identifies optimal combinations of omics modalities and explores commonalities across different cancer types. A pan-cancer analysis is conducted, focusing on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), overlapping functions and pathways, disease association networks, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots to examine survival signatures across breast (BRCA), ovarian (OV), cervical (CESC), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) cancers.

Our findings aim to improve the performance of survival models through multi-omics integration and to identify key multi-modal features that contribute to survival outcomes. This research offers valuable insights for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine.
