# TCGA_MultiOmics_Survival

Survival analysis is crucial in cancer research, providing insights into patient prognosis and potential outcomes. Advances in imaging, sequencing, and profiling technologies have made multiple omics data increasingly available, enhancing cancer diagnosis and treatment. This thesis aims to improve cancer survival predictions through feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms applied to single modalities from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We then integrate these features using early and late fusion approaches to assess the impact on survival predictions. The study identifies optimal modality combinations and explores commonalities across cancers, with a pan-cancer component focusing on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), overlapping functions and pathways, disease association networks, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots to examine survival signatures across breast (BRCA), ovarian (OV), cervical (CESC), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) cancers. Our findings aim to enhance survival model performance with multi-omics integration and identify multi-modal features contributing to survival outcomes, offering valuable insights for cancer research and personalized medicine.
